{"answer":"The warranty policies for Cybergy Holdings Inc. and creditcarscomInc exhibit significant differences. Cybergy Holdings Inc. clearly states in its warranty policy that they do not make any express or implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, which are expressly disclaimed. Their liability is limited to correcting the technology to operate in substantial accordance with current specifications or replacing the product, with any claim for breach of warranty needing to be made in writing within 90 days from the shipping date. Furthermore, Cybergy Holdings explicitly states that they are not liable for any indirect or consequential damages. \nIn contrast, the policy for creditcarscomInc includes a similar disclaimer regarding express or implied warranties but does not specify any liability terms such as the 90-day written claim requirement found in Cybergy Holdingsâ€™ policy. Instead, it refers to a general lack of warranties regarding any services provided under the Chase Affiliate Program.\nSources: Cybergy Holdings Inc., 10-Q, 5/20/2014, Section 16 - Warranties; CREDITCARDS.COM, INC., S-1, 8/10/2007, Section 20 - Warranty Disclaimer.","source":"Cybergy Holdings Inc., 10-Q, 5/20/2014; CREDITCARDS.COM, INC., S-1, 8/10/2007"}
